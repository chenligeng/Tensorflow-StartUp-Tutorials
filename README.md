# Tensorflow-StartUp-Tutorials
It is a start up tutorial for tensorflow.

Tips: this tutorial can be successfully run in windows 10 system.

Environment required:
  windows 10 system (maybe ubuntu 16.04)
  anaconda 3 (easy to install python3.6)
  pycharm (convenient for student to activate)
  library function -> tensorflow, numpy
 
Thanks to MOVAN python tutorial's video support!


[test5-BasicNN.py]:
  It is a basic 2 layers neural network to learn a regression function for f(x) = square(x) + 0.5
  
[test8-MNIST1layer.py]:
  It is a 1 layer neural network to learn the MNIST handwritten numeral dataset.
  
[test8.1-MNIST2layers.py]:
  It is a 2 layers neural network to learn the MNIST handwritten numeral dataset.
  
[test9-MNISTCnn.py]:
  It is a basic convolutional neural network to learn the MNIST handwritten numeral dataset.
  
[test10-SavePara.py]:
  It is a demo of saving parameter of network.
  
[test10.1-RestorePara.py]:
  It is a demo of restoring parameter of network.(we can only save the parameters but cannot save save the construction)

PS: Some annotations are in Chinese.
